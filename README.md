# Ontorite

**A browser-based OWL 2 ontology editor that keeps properties nested under their domain classes — the way knowledge engineers actually think.**

Protégé, WebVOWL, and PoolParty all display properties as a flat list disconnected from the classes they describe. Ontorite fixes that: every class shows the properties it is the `rdfs:domain` of, directly beneath it. Everything runs in the browser. No server, no sign-up, no installation.

## Features

### Core editing
- **Create ontologies from scratch** — set a base URI, manage prefix mappings, add multilingual labels and descriptions
- **Import existing `.ttl` files** — full Turtle parser handling prefixes, `a` shorthand, language-tagged literals, `;`/`,` shorthand, and multi-line strings
- **Export to `.ttl`** — clean, human-readable Turtle with proper prefix declarations and grouped sections
- **Properties nested under their domain class** — Object, Datatype, and Annotation properties colour-coded (blue / green / amber) and grouped beneath each class card
- **Unassigned properties bucket** — properties without a domain are surfaced separately, never silently lost

### Navigation
- **Class browser panel** — collapsible hierarchy tree for jumping between classes; double-click to navigate and highlight
- **Search / filter** — live filter across class labels and local names
- **Expand / collapse all** — one click to open or close every class card

### Individuals
- **Individuals view** — browse and inspect `owl:NamedIndividual` instances with their type assertions and property values

### Visualisation
- **Ontology graph** — full D3 force-directed graph of all classes, properties, and their relationships
- **Entity graph** — click any entity to see a focused neighbourhood graph centred on it

### Comparison
- **Ontology diff** — pick any two loaded ontologies and see exactly what was added, removed, or modified at the class and property level, with one-click merge of individual changes

### Quality
- **Validation panel** — inline errors and warnings for missing domains, duplicate URIs, type mismatches, and unlabelled entities
- **Undo / redo** — full history stack (`Ctrl+Z` / `Ctrl+Y`)
- **Clipboard** — copy a class with all its properties and paste it into the same or a different ontology

### Usability
- **Dark and light mode** — persisted per device
- **Persists across sessions** — everything is saved to IndexedDB automatically; no cloud required
- **Keyboard shortcuts** — `Ctrl+N` new class, `Ctrl+Z` undo, `Ctrl+Y` redo, `Ctrl+V` paste

## How it works

### Layout

```

```

### Typical workflows

**Starting a new ontology**
1. Click **+** in the ontology list sidebar
2. Set the base URI (e.g. `https://example.org/my-ontology/`) and a label
3. Add classes with **+ Add class** or `Ctrl+N`
4. Click **+ Add property** inside any class card — the domain is pre-filled
5. Export with the **↓ Export .ttl** button when ready

**Importing an existing ontology**
1. Click **Import** in the sidebar and pick a `.ttl` file
2. The ontology loads; classes appear with their properties already nested
3. Any properties without a domain appear in the **Unassigned properties** section at the bottom

**Comparing two versions**
1. Import both versions as separate ontologies
2. Switch to the **Diff** view and select Left and Right
3. Filter by Added / Removed / Modified / Unchanged
4. Merge individual changes with one click

<!-- screenshot: diff view -->

**Visualising the schema**
1. Switch to **Graph** for a full force-directed overview
2. Click any node to open the **Entity graph** — a focused neighbourhood view showing only that entity's direct relationships
